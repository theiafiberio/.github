# 👁️ Theia

**Theia** is a Monitoring-as-a-Service platform built for dark fiber and optical networks.  
We connect directly with monitoring devices that measure the health of fiber infrastructure and bring those insights into a unified, cloud-native platform.

## What We Do
- **Monitor fiber health in real time** — giving operators visibility into the state of their networks.  
- **Collect and analyze signals from monitoring devices** — such as optical line monitors (ALMs) used in the field.  
- **Deliver proactive alerts** — so issues can be addressed before they become outages.  
- **Provide clear dashboards and insights** — making complex infrastructure easy to understand and manage.  

---

## Our Approach
- **Cloud-native by design** — Theia scales with your network, from single operators to large enterprise deployments.  
- **Device-integrated** — we work directly with the monitoring equipment already safeguarding your fiber.  
- **Always on** — continuous monitoring and analysis ensures your network remains reliable, resilient, and transparent.

## Our Mission
To make fiber monitoring **simple, accessible, and effective**, empowering organizations to see and manage their networks with clarity.
